        Former educator turned self-taught web developer based in Orlando,
        Florida. I thrive on building exciting projects that push me beyond my
        comfort zone and fuel continuous growth. My journey from education to
        development has given me a unique perspective on problem-solving and a
        passion for creating intuitive, user-focused experiences. I specialize
        in JavaScript, React, Node.js, Next.js, and SQL, while constantly
        exploring new libraries and staying current with the latest web
        development trends. I'm currently channeling my teaching background into
        building a JavaScript course to help others discover the power and
        possibilities of programming. This project combines my love for
        education with my technical expertise. When I'm not coding, you'll find
        me exploring Orlando's vibrant art scene, working out, or reading. Let's
        build something amazing together.
