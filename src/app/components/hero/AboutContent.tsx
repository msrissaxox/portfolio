        Former educator turned self-taught web developer based in Orlando,
        Florida. I thrive on building exciting projects that push me beyond my
        comfort zone and fuel continuous growth. My journey from education to
        development has given me a unique perspective on problem-solving and a
        passion for creating intuitive, user-focused experiences. I specialize
        in <b>JavaScript</b>, <b>React</b>, <b>Node.js</b>, <b>Next.js</b>, and{' '}
        <b>SQL</b>, while constantly exploring new libraries and staying current
        with the latest web development trends. I am also skilled in{' '}
        <b>API calls</b> and have recently delved into <b>AI</b>, exploring its
        potential in web development. One of my recent projects, the{' '}
        <b>LinkedIn Post Generator</b>, showcases how I leveraged <b>OpenAI</b>{' '}
        to automate content creation, demonstrating my ability to integrate
        AI-driven solutions into my work. I&apos;m currently channeling my teaching
        background into building a <b>JavaScript course</b> to help others
        discover the power and possibilities of programming. If you&apos;d like to
        learn more about this course, <b>click here</b>. This project combines
        my love for education with my technical expertise. When I&apos;m not coding,
        you&apos;ll find me exploring Orlando&apos;s vibrant art scene, working out, or
        reading. Let&apos;s build something amazing <b>together</b>.
