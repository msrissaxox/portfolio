        I am a former educator turned self-taught Software Engineer based in
        Orlando, Florida. My journey from education to development has given me
        a unique perspective on problem-solving and a passion for creating
        intuitive, user-focused experiences. I've recently gained experience
        working within a team of developers in an agile environment. This has
        allowed me to explore collaborative coding practices, version control
        with Git, and the intricacies of working on larger projects. I enjoy the
        challenge of tackling complex problems and finding elegant solutions
        that enhance user experience alongside a team. <br />
        I specialize in <b>JavaScript</b>,{' '}
        <b>React</b>, <b>Node.js</b>, <b>Next.js</b>, and <b>SQL</b>, while
        constantly exploring new libraries and staying current with the latest
        web development trends. <br />
         One of my recent projects, the{' '}
        <b>LinkedIn Post Generator</b>, showcases how I leveraged <b>OpenAI</b>{' '}
        to automate content creation, demonstrating my ability to integrate
        AI-driven solutions into my work. I&apos;m currently channeling my
        teaching background into building a <b>JavaScript course</b> to help
        others discover the power and possibilities of programming. This project
        combines my love for education with my technical expertise. When
        I&apos;m not coding, you&apos;ll find me exploring Orlando&apos;s
        vibrant art scene, working out, or reading. <br /><br />
        Connect with me and let&apos;s build something
        amazing <b>together</b>.
